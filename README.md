# calendarAnalyser

Main goal is to prepare web application which could help analyse and edit Google Calendar, f.e. edit time of all available events.

<ul> Other concepts:
<li>Diagrams with time you've spent on something</li>
<li>Editing choosen events</li>
<li>Adding new events</li>
</ul>

Main technical project's idea is to connect Flask with Angular. 

I'll be back soon after finish engineer degree  :)
